    """In Rust, ingredients are represented and used only in whole numbers.
    However, specific crafting recipes consume specific ingredients in fractions (e.g. the oil refinery converts 2.22 wood and 1 crude oil into 3 low grade)
    so every RustIngredient quantity is a float even if the actual ingredient is a whole number.

    The [extra] argument is used to represent the amount that is needed for the original [qty]
    to be (relatively) divisible by the crafting amount of whatever recipe that requires this ingredient.
    This is done so that the original, requested quantity is not lost and only requires adding [qty] and [extra] to see the true amount.

    e.g. A user requests the ingredients needed to make 1 low grade fuel from an oil refinery.
    Because the oil refinery can only make low grade in stacks of 3, we will instantiate the result [RustIngredient] with
    the [qty] as 1 and [extra] as 2. If the user requests 2 low grade: [qty] = 2 and [extra] as 1. For 3LGF (a valid stack size): [qty] = 3, [extra] = 0

    [extra] can be None when no calculation was performed to see if any extra was actually needed. 0 is a valid amount for [extra].
